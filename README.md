# JMOO2 = Joe's Multi Objective Optimization Version 2.0

JMOO provides a python-based library of usable problems, algorithms, and tools for composition of valuable MOO-research.  Originally built in 2014, JMOO was constructed for doctoral research by Joseph Krall.  In 2017, "JMOO2" was released with higher emphasis on maintenance, documentation, clean/easy-to-read code and distribution of it to others.

JMOO2 comes with an easier-to-use interface as well as customizable built-ins so that you can setup experiments with varying settings.  JMOO2 allows you to build each of these types, so that you can customize exactly how you would like your MOEA to run.  

The customizable built-ins include:
 - Algorithms
 - Stopping Criteria (when to stop during a MOEA)
 - Perturbation (e.g. for mutation)
 - Population (e.g. for initial population)
 - Problems (test problems to run)
 - Reproduction (e.g. Crossover)
 - Return Policy (e.g. give me the last generation or the 'best' generation)
 - Selection (e.g. how to select elite members, i.e. elitism)
 - Stats (what stats to collect in each generation)
 
 Other features include:
  - Detailed Logging
  - Parallel Runners
  - Statistical Comparison
  - Graphing Utilities
